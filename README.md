# Toward Action-value Function Estimation, Social Influence, and Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
CMU Introduction to Deep Learning Spring 2021 Team Project

# Requirements:
1. PyTorch
2. OpenAI Gym: https://github.com/openai/gym
3. OpenAI Multi-Particle Environment: https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs

# Sources:
1. Baseline implementation (MADDPG): https://github.com/shariqiqbal2810/maddpg-pytorch
2. MADDPG paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275
3. QMIX paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485

# Run:

`python main.py`.

# Branches:
- The `main` branch is composed by Tony Huang (runqih@andrew.cmu.edu). It contains both the MADDPG baseline and QMIX, and is used as the cornerstone in other branches.
- The `zongyuez` branch is composed by Zongyue Zhao (zongyuez@andrew.cmu.edu). It applies social influence as a form of intrinsic motivation to the adversarial agents.
